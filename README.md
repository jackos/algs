# Algs

These are the results of going through various challenges and solutions to find the fastest and most concise algorithms. It is structured by data type so you can use the algs like:

```
let x = algs::int::reverse(255515);
```

This project is in very early state so it's bare at the moment, but it will include benchmarks, descriptions about how the algorithms work with many tests, so that over time it can grow to a useful library for very fast implementations of a wide array of useful algorithms.

All pull requests welcome.
